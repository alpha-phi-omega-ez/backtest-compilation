# backtest-compilation  
A python script to compile backtests in the Google Drive  

To set up how to use this script, please look at:  
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python  
Note that this requires a Google Cloud project with permissions, which is kind of annoying to set up  
I have already created a project at https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?pli=1&project=backtest-compilation  
The permissions that this project needs to have in Google OAuth is from the Google Drive API: 	.../auth/drive.metadata.readonly  
If you want to use my Google Cloud project, contact me I guess but it's probably better to have one for the frat
